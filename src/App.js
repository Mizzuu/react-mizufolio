                    When I finished one of my team projects, our instructor told
                    us that our app would be used by kids for an education
                    purpose. This really touched me because I realized tech can
                    help people dynamically. Once you crate an app, it could
                    benefit anyone in this world.

                    I have a three year flight attendant experience which is 180
                    degrees different from a developer. Thanks to the very
                    unique environment that I was working with different
                    colleagues and passengers every day, I earned great
                    communication skills to build a good teamwork. I am very
                    sure I utilize this skills as a developer.
